# Real-time-Emotion-detection-using-CNN
Development of a real time emotion detection using CNN.

# Packages used.
1. Tensorflow backend for keras.
2. Numpy.
3. OpenCV.

# How to run.
1. To train your own model download dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/code](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/code) and make changes according in the Model.ipynb file.
2. To download Pre-trained model follow [this link]().
3. Simply run the analyser.ipynb for execution for code.

# Upcoming
1. Improved model using transfer learning (RESNET50, EfficientNET).
2. UI interface.
